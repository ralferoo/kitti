Kitti is the Tongs’ system for keeping track of who paid for what and ensuring everything is fair (over time). No money changes hands between participants until they want to stop using Kitti.

History and lore
----------------

Kitti has been in development since 2006. The Tongs wiki contained a [conversation about communal costs][] where Fergal explains:

> KITTI’s methodology is very simple — she will look at what everyone has spent and where a tong has not benefitted from an expense, their own expenses will be increased to offset the difference. The average of the actual expenses is then calculated and the difference between offset expenses and the average will equal what is owing.

The setting then was for a single trip with fixed participants. By comparison, in this setting, the balance shown in the new Kitti reflects this difference, but running continually and among a wider group, who don’t necessarily all meet together.

[According to lore][], the name Kitti was invented following an argument about a communal kitty during a snowboarding trip in 2006. Essentially, the argument was resolved by choosing a new name for the communal costs system described above. Afterwards, a spreadsheet was developed by Fergal, Nugget and others, which did the work of the script we use today. Kitti is in fact an acronym, which, since Monkey’s rapid decision on the matter, stands for *Klau’s Intricate Transactions Totting Index*.

These Excel spreadsheets ([kitti.xls][], [newkitti.xls][]) reveal that Kitti was the name of an ancient demon goddess resurrected from the bowels of hell to wreak vengeance, but lost in the internet and trapped in these spreadsheets. You don’t need to know about this to use Kitti.

Turtle drew this picture of Kitti for us:

And told us that Kitti has a very long nose. A waggy tail. Bulging eyes to see in the dark. A bump on their head. And a big tummy.
