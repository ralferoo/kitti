Kitti is a system for keeping track of who paid for what and ensuring everything is fair (over time). No money changes hands between participants until they want to stop using Kitti.

The [current dashboard][] is automatically generated from the [transaction log][] and [letter/name mapping][]

Edit:
-----

Maybe in the future weâ€™ll allow people to add transactions via SMS, Twitter, etc. In the meantime, you must be logged into GitHub and be listed as a contributor to the repository in order to [edit the transaction log][] or to [edit the letter/name mapping][].

Examples:
---------

We write transactions as `debtors:creditors`, with letters standing for each person's name. 

For example, if three friends go out for dinner, and one of them pays 20 for it, we can write:

`A,B,C:20C   dinner`

which represents:

"Amy, Ben and Cecilia had dinner that cost 20. Cecilia paid 20."

Here are some more examples:

transaction               | meaning
--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C(50%),B:90A shoes`      | Cecilia and Ben got shoes. Cecilia's shoes were half the price of Ben's. Amy paid 90.
`B,A(4.60):10A tickets`   | Ben and Amy got tickets. Amy's ticket was 4.60. Amy paid 10.
`C,B:22.50B,18.00C dinner`| Cecilia and Ben had dinner. Ben paid 22.50. Cecilia paid 18.

We put the date in front to keep track of things. See the [transaction log][] and [letter/name mapping][] for more examples.

After those four example transactions, Kitti will tell you that each person is in debt/credit as follows:

person  | debt/credit
--------|------------
Amy     | 88.73 
Ben     | -69.82 
Cecilia | -18.92 

Maybe Ben should pay for dinner next time.

If someone wants to leave Kitti then all they have to do is pay someone in the network the amount they owe. 

These transactions will clear the debt completely:

transaction  | meaning
-------------|----------------------------
`A:18.92C`   |  Cecilia gives Amy 18.92
`A:69.82B`   |  Ben gives Amy 69.82

Fork:

If you want to use Kitti for shared expenses but don't want to be part of our network then just [fork][] the project and delete the entries to start afresh. You will need to also update the links in this README.md document.

Who is Kitti?
-------------

We asked a child. They produced this:

![kitti drawing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rawles/kitti/gh-pages/kitti.jpg)

They told us that Kitti has a very long nose. A waggy tail. Bulging eyes to see in the dark. A bump on their head. And a big tummy.
